# Code Quiz
Building a Multiple Choice Quiz to exhibit Web API skills, especially Javascript

## Description

The Code Quiz was my first from scratch Web Application, utilizing HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This involved not only the creation of functions manipulating variables, but developing javascript which dynamically updated and changed HTML and CSS while locally storing variables for use by the code at a later date.

This effort emphasized, by my own decision, Javascript over HTML or CSS. Ergo, the simplicity of the UI/UX.
